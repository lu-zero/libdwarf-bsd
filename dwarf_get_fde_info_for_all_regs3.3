.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdwarf.h
.Ft int
.Fo dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs3

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs3
retrieves a row from the register rule table associated with the given
FDE descriptor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar fde
should reference a valid DWARF FDE descriptor.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar pc
should hold the program counter address to be used to locate the
desired table row.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar reg_table
should point to a
.Vt Dwarf_Regtable3
descriptor which will hold the returned table row of register rules.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar row_pc
should point to a location which will be set to the lowest program
counter address associated with the table row.
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case of an
error.
.Pp
The
.Vt Dwarf_Regtable3
descriptor is defined in the header file
.In libdwarf.h :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct {
	Dwarf_Small	dw_offset_relevant;
	Dwarf_Small	dw_value_type;
	Dwarf_Half	dw_regnum;
	Dwarf_Unsigned	dw_offset_or_block_len;
	Dwarf_Ptr	dw_block_ptr;
} Dwarf_Regtable_Entry3;

typedef struct {
	Dwarf_Regtable_Entry3	rt3_cfa_rule;
	Dwarf_Half		rt3_reg_table_size;
	Dwarf_Regtable_Entry3	*rt3_rules;
} Dwarf_Regtable3;
.Ed
.Pp
The returned table row is stored in a
.Vt Dwarf_Regtable3
descriptor.
The
.Va rt3_cfa_rule
field is set to the CFA register rule associated with the table row.
The
.Va rt3_reg_table_size
field should store the maximum number of register rule columns to be
returned.
The table size should be set by the application before calling the
function.
The
.Va rt3_rules
should point to an array of
.Vt Dwarf_Regtable_Entry3
descriptors allocated by the application, to hold the returned
regsiter rules contained in the table row.
.Pp
For each of the register rules stored in the
.Vt Dwarf_Regtable_Entry3
descriptor,
the
.Va dw_offset_relevant
field is set to 1 if the register rule has a offset value.
The
.Va dw_value_type
field is set to the type code of the register rule.
The
.Va dw_regnum
field is set to the register number assoicated with the regsiter rule.
If the register rule is of type
.Dv DW_EXPR_OFFSET
or
.Dv DW_EXPR_VAL_OFFSET ,
the
.Va dw_offset_or_block_len
field is set to the offset value associated with the register rule.
If the type code is
.Dv DW_EXPR_EXPRESSION
or
.Dv DW_EXPR_VAL_EXPRESSION ,
the
.Va dw_offset_or_block_len
field is set to the length in bytes of the DWARF expression block
associated with the register rule.
The
.Va dw_block_ptr
field is set to a pointer to the content of the DWARF expression block
associated with the register rule.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs3
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK
when it succeeds.
In case of an error, it returns
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_all_regs3
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_PC_NOT_IN_FDE_RANGE"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
One of the arguments
.Ar fde ,
.Ar reg_table
or
.Ar row_pc
was NULL.
.It Bq DW_DLE_PC_NOT_IN_FDE_RANGE
The program counter value provided in argument
.Ar pc
did not fall in the range covered by argument
.Ar fde .
