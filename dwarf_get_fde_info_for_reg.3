.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg
retrieves a register rule from the regsiter rule table associated
with the given FDE descriptor. The function locates the desired
register rule using the provided column number and program counter
address.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar fde
should reference a valid DWARF FDE descriptor.
.Pp
Arugment
.Ar table_column
should hold the column number of the desired register rule.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar pc_requested
should hold a program counter address which will be used to locate the
row number of the desired register rule.
.Pp
If a register rule was found, function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg
stores the register rule information in the
locations pointed to by arguments
.Ar offset_relevant ,
.Ar register_num ,
.Ar offset
and
.Ar row_pc .
.Pp
If there is an offset value assoicated with the found register rule,
the location pointed to by argument
.Ar offset_relevant
will be set to 1.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar register_num
should point to a location which will hold the register number associated
with the found register rule.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar offset
should point to a location which will be set to the offset value
assoicated with the found register rule, or 0 if the register rule
doesn't have an offset value.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar row_pc
should point to a location which will be set to the lowest program
counter address associated with the found register rule.
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to return an error descriptor in case
of an error. 
.Ss COMPATIBILITY
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg
is deprecated since it only supports DWARF2 frame section. Application
should instead use function
.Xr dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3 3
which supports both DWARF2 and DWARF3 frame sections.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg
returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK
when it succeeds.
In case of an error, it returns
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and sets the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
One of the arguments
.Ar fde ,
.Ar offset_relevant ,
.Ar register_num ,
.Ar offset
or
.Ar row_pc
was NULL.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_FRAME_TABLE_COL_BAD
The column number provided in argument
.Ar table_column
was too large.
