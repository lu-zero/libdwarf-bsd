.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions retrieve information about static functions from the
lookup tables in the SGI specific
.Dq ".debug_funcnames"
DWARF section.
Information about static functions are returned using opaque descriptors
of type
.Vt Dwarf_Func .
An application needs to use the functions described below to retrieve
the name and offset information contained in these descriptors.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_funcs
retrieves descriptors for all the static functions associated with the
DWARF debug context specified by argument
.Ar dbg .
The argument
.Ar funcs
should point to a location that will be set to a pointer to an array
of
.Vt Dwarf_Func
descriptors.
The argument
.Ar nfuncs
should point to a location that will be set to the number of
descriptors returned.
.Pp
The memory area used for the array of
.Vt Dwarf_Func
descriptors returned is owned by the
.Lb libdwarf .
An application should not attempt to directly free this pointer.
Portable code should instead use
.Fn dwarf_funcs_dealloc
to indicate that the memory area may be freed.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_func_die_offset
retrieves the section-relative offset of the debugging information
entry associated with the argument
.Ar func ,
and stores it into the location pointed to by the argument
.Ar die_offset .
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_func_cu_offset
returns the section-relative offset of the compilation unit that
contains the debugging information entry associated with the argument
.Ar func .
Argument
.Ar cu_offset
should point to a location that will hold the returned offset.
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_func_name_offsets
retrieves both the name and the offset of the debugging information
entry for argument
.Ar func .
Argument
.Ar name
should point to a location which will be set to a pointer to a
NUL-terminated string containing the name of the associated debugging
information entry.
Argument
.Ar die_offset
should point to a location which will be set to a section-relative
offset of the associated debugging information entry.
Argument
.Ar cu_die_offset
should point to a location which will be set to a
section-relative offset of the first debugging information entry in
the compilation unit associated with argument
.Ar func .
.Pp
Function
.Fn dwarf_funcname
sets the location pointed to by argument
.Ar name
to a pointer to a NUL-terminated string holding the name of the
debugging information entry associated with the argument
.Ar func .
.Ss Error Returns
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, these functions will use it to store error information,
in case of an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, these functions returns
.Dv DW_DLV_OK .
In case of an error, they return
.Dv DW_DLV_ERROR
and set the argument
.Ar err .
.Sh ERRORS
These functions may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
